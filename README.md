# Pair-Trading
##Pairs Selection by applying PCA and OPTICS clustering to stock prices

This notebook contain machine learning approach to find stocks which has similar or alternative price change or which has some kind of dependencies. I'm using optic cluster to find out the group of stocks which has similar returns and then using Engle-Granger Test, Hurst Exponent Calculation, Half-life Calculation to find out pairs. I also used PCA to reduce the data size without compromising information.

You can see the possible 10 pair in the graphs. Please use proper risk management strategy before using for real trade.

TODO: Backtesting is still under development.
